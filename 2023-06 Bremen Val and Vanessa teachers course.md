# Recap structured

## History etc
- The movement of zouk is mostly influenced by the drums (in Brazil they have drums in all the music )
- We are starting with left backward because it is easier for followers. L knows what he is leading and when, but F have no idea. So we want the easier for then.  It's like when are driving the car, for the driver it's always eaiser to prepare and expect the turns compared to the passenger.
## Philosophy 
- Dancing is 50/50, both partners have something to say
	- that includes also listening to the music
- Don't dance the system, dance the dance (if it doesn't look like it and you do only the steps then no one could recognize that it's zouk). 
- Teacher is just a student that is learning longer. 
- Vanessa is always trying to keep her own technique (because it is 50/50)
- Dancing is like speaking language. Sometimes two people don't speak the same language but they want to try to understand eachother. One can learn from the second one. Or they don't have to want to understand each other. **If people want, they can always understand eachother in dance**. 
- We never try to force as leader. We try to convince. Not by force but by ourselves moving differently  (example when he started to move fluently in front of Vanessa and she started moving subconciously)
## Pedagogy
- Recapping on the beginning of next lesson - giving some responsibility to the students. Let them show it to you or at least tell you. If you take all the responsibility, they will get used to it and not remember so much. 
- They are talking about the suspension and everything else even in the beginning for beginners  but they don't expect the results. But they show them the full result In he beginning. 
- If it's simple and feels good, you come back.
- Using simple language to understand it better. 
   > In Stolárna think about the terminology for the students (frame, suspension?)
- Teachers should be open to say everything to anyone. You are not there to comfort them, you are there to help. 
- Never say "relax". Especially in connection with the word "have to". It's impossible to feel relaxing. 
- Everything you teach you have to make them feel. 
- Students are babies, we cannot feed the babies with hamburger (all technique with some elements). How much can babies digest? When the baby becomes teenagers you can change the way you talk to them. 
  >Write some example of showing how to explain basic step to beginners, intermediate and advanced (or some other element)
- We try to give our partner biggest context possible (visibly with our body)
- Stop teaching position and angle and start teaching movement. 
- Trying to tell your students how does some element feel. So when they get the feeling, they know they got there. 
## Technique
Tension is the way to prepare for movement. If we are tense all the time, then the follower cannot know what is coming.  ^f4f7a4

In zouk we have much more feeling of pulling than pushing. 

Talking about relaxation in fast songs
Raising hands, make fist, trying to squeeze hard. Trying to move the wrist very fast and it's almost impossible (this happens when we tense up during fast song). Then we keep the fist but don't squeeze and it goes much better. - It's much more tiring to be walking very fast than running. 

Pulling - it's easier than using your body and feet. Sometimes it happens because we talk about our balance is above our head. But the balance is moving with us. 
They say that balance doesn't exist, we have to accept that we are losing the balance all the time but we are controlling it. 
### Creating the steps
There are two types of making steps -either we push up (suspension) or we ground down. The hips movement is just a result of a suspension of body 

In their philosophy they try to use more back thighs and bottom muscles to move front (some teachers are going down earlier so the movement uses more the muscles of thighs in front)

On first step we try to suspend our energy up, second step catch the weight (absorb) and continue to release on third step down. So it's continuous arch. 

**Suspension**
It's mostly how we push to the ground, we don't necessarily have to change the level of whole body. 

**Grounding**
When we go down we just try to release the energy (like small babies when they dance)

Feeling of drawing infinity with your body. 

Even basic front and back is still infinity. 

Hips are turning together with the movement (they are not facing only forward). If I go with my right forward the hip will be rotated towards the feet. 

They start pushing from the hips. Weight goes to toes, hips go to the direction where I go, I go. The intention of going forward when I am going forward.  (Exercise for pushing the partner - to not be afraid to push our partner)

In basic step fixing people to push forward into my partner with step. Naturally we are stepping smaller step backward so we are helping the other person to go bigger step back. Also who is going forward sees what is behind so he will not push if there is something behind his partner. 

Exercise with trying to step on eachother feet. 
- makes people dance closer
- helping with suspension to the front (because we cannot suspense so much up )
The worst thing for step forward leading is when someone is pulling me forward

> [!Exercise] 
>  going basic step forward solo
>  - only Tum, trying to keep the energy forward all the time
>  - Tum back 
>  - Tum čik čik forward and back
>  - Body has a bit different timing than feet. Feet are "stopping" in the suspension a little but body is continuing in the movement. Because it has a bit more delay and range, it can start the change of the direction.
>  - She stopped us from brushing our feet on the floor (because then we don't really do the step properly and control our weight) - later Klárka asked her and Vanessa said it was mainly for L because if they brush the floor they won't lead the step properly. 


### Types of frame
4 spots for contact
1. When we are really close, we are trying to hold the further shoulder blade
2. When we are further, contact is in the closest shoulder blade
3. Third spot is on the arm
4. Then only open hands (like in lateral)
Game when teacher says the numbers and they try to change the contact and they figure out the distance based on the contact

From 1 to 4 in a movement it's actually preparation for [[Oddálení + přiblížení]]

Similar game when we did the same in [[Basic step]] in movement. Mention sliding the hands between changing the distance. 

They use it in explaining the elements (for example viradinha during opening is going into 2 and then back to 1).

### Elasticity
Playing with balance on your feet alone, if you feel like moving body or making steps (with falling), it's okay.

- Going two steps to one direction and two steps other. Trying to always let our body move a little bit more (over the foot). 
	- introducing the idea of elasticity

Showing elasticity in couple - we are holding in the connection 4 and going further away until we feel the tension
### Connection
> [!Exercise]
> Walking forward and back without leader's frame and just F is trying to take the information with her right hand on L back. Leader is trying to speed up but not bring any tension in his body. 
> ![[#^f4f7a4]]

### Premovement and preparation
Exercise when he says the sound with some rhythm and we should play imaginative drums. It shows how we plan with the movement of the hand.  Try to play the drums with other parts of the body one by one (shoulders, chest, hips,..)
He also told someone that he should jump out to reach the ceiling - showed the natural preparation. 

Difference between premovement and preparation
Preparation - movement leading to some other movement specific to zouk
Premovement - very similar, more organic way
For example when you want to jump, then before the jump. Premovement always starts to the opposite direction of the movement. (he was telling someone to jump and showing how the body prepares automatically for the movement)

Premovement for [[Oddálení + přiblížení]] is showing with my body that we go forwardy we just don't step. 
### Modulacion (modulation)

Changing direction in organic way most of the time comes from up to the bottom

5 parts
- head
- chest
- hips
- knees
- feet

We can see It for example in turn or lateral, that the head is leading the movement and then the rest of the body is following. (he was showing it on an example when you go on a street and someone shouts your name)

Exercise when we are not touching, L is going around and F is trying to look always with nose to his chest and turn only when she cannot turn the head anymore. Correct the students if they are turning chest together with hips (try to isolate more). After the hips and legs are turning in almost the same time. 

Playing with it, going there and back, turning only the chest for the F. When the hips are turning, the L has to wait until F is turned completely.
## Elements
### Basic step old time
L starting with right foot diagonal frwd, going to lot of suspension (almost feeling like he is falling to the direction of movement), small step cross and side. Back the same way.

The old way of holding arms was with L left hand up. Because it unlocks the chest to move more and also doesn't allow the leader or follower to push to the frame. 
Later when they already knew something, they could start having the "regular" frame. 
Other option is to have the hand completely down. 

In basic step using this suspension on TUm (for Val it is a feeling like small body wave in the old style basic). 

- Showing three lines ^14e29c
	1. the line we are sharing
	2. line on the left side of leader
	3. line on the right side of leader
- Preparation for [[Launch]] etc (three steps forward) is coming from the old time basic step
- they teach [[Elastico#Elastico going around the partner|Elastico going around the partner]] before [[Lateral]] because students got introduced to the concept of going to different direction than their partner
	- they were teaching it again thanks to their definition of lines [[#^14e29c]]
### [[Viradinha]]

Leader is going first to the second line, and then going back (they are not closing the lady, but coming back to her). Follower is going only straight ([[Lateral]]). Also because they start diagonally with their body in [[Basic step]], it is easier to rotate with body.
### [[Oddálení + přiblížení]]
Preparation for [[Oddálení + přiblížení]] - bringing the L left hand down. Then the hand is doing what they call spiderman (they are not changing the grip). 
### [[Lateral]]
In Brazil they have 4 ways to say lateral 
- corridor (because they should imagine that they are holding a tray and they cannot drop it)
- bull fighter (torero) (we are stepping inside of F corridor and F is trying to stay in her corridor)
- tray (bandega)

For leaders - step forward and show hips to my follower. Follower is trying to bump with her hip (making the hip turn in the right way without explaining ). Also because of this f is starting to use the floor. Also the leaders need to be fast enough to not get bumped. Leader is trying to go around the partner (which helps with the right chest rotation) 

**After they asked the F to keep the nose to the leader.** Eyes are not helping and this is also easier than saying turn your chest. This is the most natural way of turning (when someone calls you by name on the street).

They say that lateral is viradinha (steps for F).

In the end F is trying to do all in the same time - attack with hips, stay in the same corridor and L is trying to carry the tray .

They try to not tell leaders too much about arms, more about stepping around the partner, because it becomes less mechanical. 

They don't think about keeping the circle with the frame all the time, more like keeping the distance with hands. 

The body of F is not completely pointing to Leader as we teach. It's a little bit but not completely. 

When we rotate the chest it's not the shoulders. We are trying to think about the part between breasts.
#### Teaching lateral
**F steps** 
- forward, forward, turn, forward. Keeping weight always forward after transfering the weight
- Second step a little bit up and third down.  
- Long up down (it's a little bit different than the suspension they explained in the beginning > Vanessa said that they say it like this to the beginners so it results in the same suspension)
- We bent both knees when we go down
- On thirds step turn a little bit more (hips attack)

Then we do it together with L. Follower doesn't have the information about nose yet.
Then we add the nose following. 
We are not holding. Doing steps very slowly. F is trying to follow L chest with nose. 

**Leaders step**
- We are trying to always collect leg before going front (not going diagonally)
- Going step right just with suspension, leaving left leg up. Then going the front step. Then also turning the nose towards the partner.
- Don't forget about the big first step (otherwise we can pull the partner) also the partner will understand better what she should do. 

Only when I am going to bring the hips somewhere, I am going to change the direction. 

Little exercise when they turn the feet together with the upper body to make them realize more that they can turn it like this in lateral. 
![[#Lateral common mistakes]]

In lateral - connect it with the [[#Elasticity|tension in arms]]. When we are closer, the arms are more relaxed. 3 distances - close, far and very far. The further we are the more tension it has. 

Leaders tried to keep the right tension but with smaller steps just by bringing arms down.

#### Lateral going around 
- first showing the steps for L (changing the lines ). Introducing the idea of turn. 
- When they want to finish into basic step they just go into first line and first position of hands. 
### Open lateral (abegtura)
For them it's not so much about the idea of distance, but more like a hinge at a door (the shoulder is the hinge. Open can be close or far away.  It can help telling students to connect their shoulders before open. 

To lead the open L just needs to put  hand down when leading [[Lateral]] and then **release it up** (not actively push).

If we teach that the F needs to be far away, it makes L to push more. Open doesn't neccesarily mean distance. 

In lateral we are switching places, in open leader is staying in the place. Sometimes they call it follower opening. 
> Our open we teach usually that both roles are going to the other direction to open in a distance.

When going from open to boomerang or something else, the leader is going last step cross, to create the elasticity and preparation for the movement.

When the open cross is not working, I can bring my hand even lower for her to understand. But first is the premovement. 

F steps in lateral open, going down up down like a circle with hips (gorila))

Leader is also going into suspension, but not on ball of his foot (like F), more in his body.

### [[Es]]
Changing direction. But not doing three steps. 
L has to make a little suspension before we do it (make a little bigger distance with upper body  - little similar like before headmovement in lateral). But I am not changing the line of the shoulders. From Val I felt that he has still relaxed body but trying to push from his foot. Still present, relaxed but change something that the follower can feel. 
## Common mistakes
- When you see people swaying during dances, it is usually because they have feet too far apart from eachother. In zouk we try to move almost on the same line when we go front and back. 
### Lateral common mistakes
- Correcting F to turn too fast - telling them to keep walking forward with feet and turn just with nose. 
- Loosing the attack - F is trying to change the place with your partner. 
- F are feeling [[Es]] instead of lateral - guys are tensing up too soon.
## Personal feedback for me
- I should always stay longer in TUM, [[Pião]] should turn more. Val was saying that if we don't turn a lot then it is just turning basic step for them 
## After class
Question about turns (how active are followers in their philosophy)
They are not using almost at all the word resist. 
Exercise when he breaks the frame and follower is fixing her frame by repositioning her body. Then we try to do it almost at the same time. 

## My ideas from Val and Vanessa teachers traning
> Zkusit to pro L navést bez rukou ([[Oddálení + přiblížení]]), aby se naučili používat správnou přípravu do pohybu. 

> [[Giving feedback in a dance]] - Bring papers for class and let them write what other people can improve and what they do good. Make sure it will not be only about one person. Without naming anyone and then we will talk about it. (But what if the right person is not listening to it?)

> some video or tutorial of how to take notes for dancers (during classes, after classes etc). Zkratky, program, zpracovávání poznámek po lekci!! [[Progressive summarization]] 

> Meta teaching - teaching about teaching. 

> Class for only transitions in a dance. 

> Idea from dancing next to [[Fernando]] - dancing next to someone and trying to copy their movement. The original couple always stays and wait for the person to finish.

> Teaching already in the beginning the preparation to the basic step forward (then they would have to learn to start a little bit before 1, which could be hard)

> Teaching our student continuation of energy impulse.

> Exercise where students should bump eachother with viradinha. It will teach them to stop and control their movement 

> It's not about controlling the follower, but giving her invitations. 

> Hips movement and connection to block of sexual energy in Europe. Trying to research it and figure out how to connect it into some kind of workshop or trying to put some energy relaxement into classes.
